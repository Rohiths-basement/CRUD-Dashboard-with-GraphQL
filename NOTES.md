## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Modular, reusable components with clear separation of concerns
- **State Management**: Apollo Client for GraphQL state + React hooks for local state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom utility classes and component variants
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth, performant animations
- **Type Safety**: PropTypes validation and consistent data flow patterns

### Backend Architecture
- **GraphQL Schema**: Comprehensive type definitions matching business requirements
- **Mock Data**: Realistic sample data with proper relationships
- **Resolvers**: Business logic implementation with filtering and mutations
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin setup for development

### Data Flow
1. **Queries**: Products, Warehouses, and KPIs fetched via GraphQL
2. **Mutations**: Update Demand and Transfer Stock operations
3. **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refetching after mutations
4. **Caching**: Apollo Client intelligent caching for performance

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Blue tones for main actions and branding
- **Status Colors**: Green (Healthy), Yellow (Low), Red (Critical)
- **Neutral**: Gray scale for text and backgrounds
- **Dark Mode**: Carefully selected dark theme variants

### Typography
- **Headings**: Inter font family with proper weight hierarchy
- **Body Text**: Consistent sizing and line heights
- **Monospace**: Code/SKU display with proper formatting

### Spacing & Layout
- **Grid System**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- **Spacing Scale**: Consistent 4px base unit scaling
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile-first responsive design

## 📊 Business Logic Implementation

### Status Calculation
```javascript
// Healthy: stock > demand (Green)
// Low: stock === demand (Yellow)  
// Critical: stock < demand (Red)
```

### Fill Rate Formula
```javascript
fillRate = (sum(min(stock, demand)) / sum(demand)) * 100
```

### KPI Calculations
- **Total Stock**: Sum of all product stock values
- **Total Demand**: Sum of all product demand values
- **Trends**: Percentage change over selected time period

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced Search**: 300ms delay to prevent excessive API calls
- **Pagination**: 10 items per page to manage large datasets
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- **Memoization**: Expensive calculations cached appropriately

### Error Handling
- **GraphQL Errors**: Proper error boundaries and user feedback
- **Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms and offline indicators
- **Validation**: Form validation with clear error messages
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation for missing data

### Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactions
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color combinations
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order

## 🚦 Testing Strategy
